In todayâ€™s digital era, the wristwatch market is immense and offers diverse styles, designs, and features. However, the ability to visualize a watch on one's wrist before purchase is a significant hurdle for consumers, often resulting in uncertainty and hesitation.
The project aims to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) Watch Try-On application, which enables users to see a realistic, interactive virtual display of various wristwatch models on their wrist using mobile devices. This experience will help potential customers make informed decisions, enhancing their confidence in purchasing watches.
Customers often struggle to envision how a watch will look on their wrist, leading to doubt in their purchase decisions. The AR Watch Try-On application addresses this by providing a digital experience where users can virtually try on watches, overcoming physical limitations and enhancing the buying experience
